I am a computer scientist and part of the [Automated Reasoning Group](https://arg.cs.uni-kl.de/en/) group led by [Anthony W. Lin](https://anthonywlin.github.io/) at the Rheinland-Pfälzische Technische Universität (RPTU), Kaiserslautern, Germany.

## Research

Currently, my research interests lie in the interface between formal methods and machine / deep learning. In particular, I am currently working on understanding the computational complexity of formal reasoning
tasks for various neural network based models, like feedforward neural networks, graph neural networks
or transformers.
