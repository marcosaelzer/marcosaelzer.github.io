I am a PhD student (supervised by [Prof. Martin Lange](https://carrick.fmv.informatik.uni-kassel.de/~mlange/index.html)) and 
part of the [Formal Methods / Theoretical Computer Science](https://www.uni-kassel.de/eecs/en/sections/theoretical-computer-science-/-formal-methods/about-us) group at the University of Kassel, Germany.

### Research

Currently, my research interests lie in the interface between formal methods and machine / deep learning. In particular, I am working on the verification of different neural network models and related 
problems from the perspective formal methods.
