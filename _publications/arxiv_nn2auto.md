Verifying properties and interpreting the behaviour of deep neural networks (DNN) is an important task given their ubiquitous use in applications, including safety-critical ones, and their blackbox nature. We 
propose an automata-theoric approach to tackling problems arising in DNN analysis. We show that the input-output behaviour of a DNN can be captured precisely by a (special) weak Büchi automaton of exponential 
size. We show how these can be used to address common verification and interpretation tasks like adversarial robustness, minimum sufficient reasons etc. We report on a proof-of-concept implementation 
translating DNN to automata on finite words for better efficiency at the cost of losing precision in analysis.
