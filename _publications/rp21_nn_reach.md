We investigate the complexity of the reachability problem for (deep) neural networks: does it compute valid output given some valid input? It was recently claimed that the problem is NP-complete
for general neural networks and conjunctive input/output specifications. We repair some flaws in the original upper and lower bound proofs. We then show that NP-hardness already holds for restricted classes
of simple specifications and neural networks with just one layer, as well as neural networks with minimal requirements on the occurring parameters.'
